# Code owners are automatically requested for review
# when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own.
# Code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests.
#
# To use a CODEOWNERS file, create a new file called CODEOWNERS
# in the root, docs/, or .github/ directory of the repository,
# in the branch where you'd like to add the code owners.
# Each CODEOWNERS file assigns the code owners for a single branch in the repository.
# Thus, you can assign different code owners for different branches.
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
