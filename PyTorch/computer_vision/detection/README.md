# Detection for Pytorch
This folder contains scripts to run Detection models on Habana Gaudi<sup>TM</sup> device to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Please visit [this page](https://developer.habana.ai/resources/habana-training-models/#performance) for performance information.

For more information about training deep learning models on Gaudi, visit [developer.habana.ai](https://developer.habana.ai/resources/).

The demos included in this release are as follows:

## Models for detection
- Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD) with RN34 as backend from mlcommons repo

The environment variables in training scripts are used to achieve optimal results for each workload.
