# Diffusion Model Details

This directory contains three stable diffusion projects. Each folder contains detailed instructions on how to use them. The stable-diffusion-v-2-1 project is specifically designed for inference, the stable-diffusion and stable-diffusion-finetuning projects are suitable for training only. 

Stable-diffusion-v-2-1 is recommended to run `inference`. To run `training`, you can use the stable-diffusion project.

### Overview:

* stable-diffusion-v-2-1: is the latest Intel Gaudi-optimized version of stable diffusion (v2.1) and is based on https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion/tree/d55bcd4d31d0316fcbdf552f2fd2628fdc812500.
* stable-diffusion: is designed for training, based on the first version of stable diffusion https://github.com/pesser/stable-diffusion/tree/a166aa7fbf578f41f855efeab2e14001d6732563.
* stable-diffusion-finetuning: is designed for training on stable diffusion (v2.1) and is based on https://github.com/cloneofsimo/lora/tree/bdd51b04c49fa90a88919a19850ec3b4cf3c5ecd
