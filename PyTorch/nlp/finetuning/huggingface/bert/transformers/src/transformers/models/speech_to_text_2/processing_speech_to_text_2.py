    Constructs a Speech2Text2 processor which wraps a Speech2Text2 feature extractor and a Speech2Text2 tokenizer into
    a single processor.

    more information.

            An instance of [`AutoFeatureExtractor`]. The feature extractor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`Speech2Text2Tokenizer`):
