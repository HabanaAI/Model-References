# Long Form Question Answering

This folder contains the code for the Long Form Question answering [demo](http://35.226.96.115:8080/) as well as methods to train and use a fully end-to-end Long Form Question Answering system using the [ðŸ¤—transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and [ðŸ¤—nlp](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp) libraries.

You can use these methods to train your own system by following along the associate [notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/longform-qa/Long_Form_Question_Answering_with_ELI5_and_Wikipedia.ipynb) or [blog post](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html).
