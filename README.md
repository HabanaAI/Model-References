## Model List and Performance Data

Please visit [this page](https://developer.habana.ai/resources/habana-training-models/#performance) for performance information.

This repository is a collection of models that have been ported to run on Intel Gaudi AI accelerator. They are intended as examples, and will be reasonably optimized for performance while still being easy to read.
