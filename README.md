# Habana Deep Learning Examples for Training and Inference

## Introduction
This repository provides State-of-the-Art Deep Learning examples that are easy to train and deploy, achieving the best reproducible accuracy and performance with Habana(R) Gaudi and Goya Accelerators

## Habana Cloud Container Registry
These examples, along with our Habana deep learning software stack, are provided in a monthly updated Docker container on the Container registry (https://developer.habana.ai/catalog). These containers include:  

- The latest Habana examples from this repository
- The latest Habana contributions shared upstream to the respective framework
- [Monthly release notes](https://developer.habana.ai/docs) for each of the optimized containers
