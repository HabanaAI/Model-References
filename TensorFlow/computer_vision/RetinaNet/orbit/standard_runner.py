"""AbstractTrainer/Evaluator subclasses with added functionality.

The classes in this module provide some additional structure to the bare
`AbstractTrainer`/`AbstractEvaluator` APIs.

Both `StandardTrainer` and `StandardEvaluator` split the train/eval loops into
"begin", "step", and "end" methods, and provide an implementation of the loop
itself that makes calls to the relevant step method.

`StandardTrainer` supports running the loop using the TF while loop construct
for added performance (particularly on TPUs). It additionally provides some
functionality to make writing summaries from inside a model more performant when
running on TPUs.

These classes are intended to work well in common settings, however there may
be use cases these classes don't support (for instance, `StandardEvaluator` in
particular doesn't support running full evaluations over multiple different eval
datasets). Users are encouraged to simply fall back to custom `AbstractTrainer`
and `AbstractEvaluator` subclasses in these cases.
